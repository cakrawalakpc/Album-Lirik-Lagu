Almost Soulmate - Ungu

I know that's all my fault
Cause I never seem to care
I know that's all my fault
Cause I never fight for loosing you

I realize it now
It's a foolish things to do
I do realize it now
How this love should be taking care of
For every step I take
Makes me know how I feel

How I love you, I realize it now
You're the living gift I have
Sure I love you for being the best thing in my life
Seems sometime I too forget how I am being in love
You're the reason of my life
Like a soulmate suppose to be

Oh but how could this be
It really haunted me
and maybe we are meant for each other

How I love you, I realize it now
You're the living gift I have
Sure I love you for being the best thing in my life
Seems sometime I too forget how i am being in love
You're the reason of my life
You're the reason of my life
Like a soulmate suppose to be
Like a soulmate suppose to be
