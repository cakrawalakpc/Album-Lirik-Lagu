Away (OST. Dreams) - Fatin

you had your raybans on
sneakers and worn out clothes
i had to walk up right away

we spoke your cool came off
usually don't take it home
feels like i know you already

gave it a shot, had time to care
you know just how to talk and you get me
fourty four caliber to spare
cupid sure really knows how to hit me

i said let's get together
you can go ahead so make my days

let's run away away away away away away away
away away away away away away away away away

go to le boulevard, late to see sun fall
minutes after turned to hours
we kept on walking on, your shirt kept the cold off
engaged in the night to get ours

though im not a model chic
i know the runway so make my day

let's run away away away away away away away
away away away away away away away

wonder where you came from
i've never met someone who understands me right away
not looking at nobody, i was blinded
was only one way minded, so what do you say

we get away away away away away away away
away away away away away away away
we get away away away away away away away
let's get away away away away away away away
we get away away away away away away
